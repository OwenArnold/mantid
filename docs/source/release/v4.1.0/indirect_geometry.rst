:ref:`Release 4.1.0 <v4.1.0>`

Algorithms
----------

Improvements
############

- :ref:`ModeratorTzeroLinear <algm-ModeratorTzeroLinear>` permits now passing parameter values as input properties.
- :ref:`BASISPowderDiffraction <algm-BASISPowderDiffraction>` resolves between run with old and new DAS
- :ref:`BASISReduction <algm-BASISReduction>` permits now flux normalization by proton charge and run duration.
- :ref:`BASISCrystalDiffraction <algm-BASISCrystalDiffraction>` resolves between run with old and new DAS.


Data Analysis Interface
-----------------------

Improvements
############
- Improved the output options of MSD Fit, Iqt Fit, Conv Fit and F(Q)Fit so that Chi_squared can now be plotted.

Bug Fixes
#########
- Fixed an error caused by loading a Sample into ConvFit which does not have a resolution parameter for the analyser.
- Fixed a crash caused by changing the Preview Spectrum on Elwin after clicking Run.


Data Reduction Interface
------------------------

Bug Fixes
#########
- Fixed a bug in the :ref:`Integration <algm-Integration>` algorithm causing the Moments tab to crash.
